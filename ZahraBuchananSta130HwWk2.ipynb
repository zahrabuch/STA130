    "6.1 I think the chatbot was very quick when it came to giving me the solutions for questions like 1, 2, and 3 when I asked it to explain the Monte Hall code and to find a simpler version. It got straight to the point for these questions but for questions 4-5 it took a bit longer to reach the specific answer I was looking for when asked about the Markovian Chatbot code and its extensions. However, the explanations for the Markovian codes were very quick and the first thing to appear each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.2 Interacting with the chatbot for certain questions can be slightly frustrating because most times it will give you a list of responses to choose from and then none of them end up being exactly what you are looking for. For example, question 5 when I asked the chatbot about the Markovian extension it kept suggesting ways to improve the code instead of outling the differences. It also gave me multiple differences that were not exactly what I was looking for even when I tried to guide it in the right direction. So I think that in some cases it can be frustrating.\n",

    "6.3 When it comes to helping me understand code I think the chatbot does a great job. Usually when I ask the the chatbot about a code it will break it up into different segments and explain how each part works which is normally straightforward and useful. I can also ask follow up questions and with this the chatbot will tend to explain a concept using examples which makes it much clearer. Last week when we were asked to show the chatbot errors it actually was veery useful in providing solutions in the context of my code which made fixing the errors quick and simple."

    "7. Since starting the course I have realized chatbots can be extremly helpful in explaining blocks of code. Usually when people would refer to the use of Chatbots it would mainly be for generating code or looking for solutions to problems but it actually a great tool for learning. When using a chatbot you can ask it to explain a concept in as much depth as possible or you can even ask it to use analogies when explaining which I personally find really helpful. You can also ask the chatbot as many follow up questions as necessary and it responses are always specific to whatever code you have asked about. In the field of data science I think its necessary to utilize tools like this as there are so many things to learn and understand. "
